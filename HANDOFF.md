# JOI Payroll & HR App — Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-14

Quick reference for picking the project back up on a new machine.

## Getting set up on a new computer

Clone the repo, install, and run the dev server:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandoval-art/JOI-payroll-hr.git
cd JOI-payroll-hr
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite picks).

You'll need a `.env` file at the project root with your Supabase keys. If you don't have the file, copy them from the Supabase dashboard (Project Settings → API) and create:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

## Accounts

| Email | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| diomedes.sandoval@justoutsource.it | Owner | Real login for D (owner-level access) |
| sandoval.028@gmail.com | Agent | Test account to QA the employee experience |
| (Paty's email) | Admin | Paty Rodriguez |
| (Joe's email) | Manager | Joe Renteria — not yet seeded, add via UI |
| (Wendy / Ruben / Javier emails) | Team Lead | Create via UI once they sign up |

## Architecture in 30 seconds

React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + TanStack React Query + shadcn/ui + Tailwind.

Route gating is driven by `useAuth()` in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`. It reads `user_profiles.role` which is auto-synced from `employees.title` via a Postgres trigger.

Five-tier title hierarchy (owner → admin → manager → team_lead → agent) is the single source of truth for permissions. Anything `isLeadership` (owner+admin+manager) sees everything including pay. Team leads see team-scoped data without pay. Agents see only their own stuff.

## Permission model

| Permission | Owner | Admin | Manager | Team Lead | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| See payroll / pay info | yes | yes | yes | no | own only |
| Edit shift times | yes | yes | yes | yes (own campaign) | no |
| Approve time off | yes | yes | yes | yes (own team) | request own |
| View team EOD | yes | yes | yes | yes (own team) | own only |
| Clock in / out | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |

Owner and Admin are functionally identical today. D may spec owner-only powers later.

## Database migrations

Run these in order via the Supabase SQL editor if setting up a fresh database. All files are in `supabase/migrations/`.

1. `20260401165427_*.sql` — initial schema (original Lovable scaffold)
2. `20260401171237_*.sql` — schema tweaks
3. `20260401230853_*.sql` — more scaffold
4. `20260413000001_full_setup.sql` — consolidated setup (clients, employees, payroll, time_clock, user_profiles, etc.)
5. `20260413000002_seed_employees.sql` — seeds known employees
6. `20260413000003_update_salaries.sql` — salary overrides per D's numbers
7. `20260413120000_timeclock_breaks_and_auto_clockout.sql` — break-aware timeclock columns
8. `20260413120100_auto_clockout_function.sql` — pg_cron auto-clockout every 5 min
9. `20260413130000_shift_seasons.sql` — **no-op** (we decided not to use season toggle)
10. `20260413140000_titles_and_reports_to.sql` — 5-tier title system + reports_to + shift audit log

One-off fix files (run once, not migrations):
- `supabase/fix_owner_and_test_account.sql` — corrects D's test account back to agent and tags the real owner. Run this AFTER creating the diomedes.sandoval@justoutsource.it auth user.
- `supabase/seed_test_employee_daniel.sql` — creates the Daniel Sandoval test employee linked to sandoval.028@gmail.com
- `supabase/seed_shift_settings_defaults.sql` — default shifts for Big Think, HFB, Torro/Scoop
- `supabase/seed_shift_settings_sloc.sql` — SLOC Weekday + Weekend shifts

## What's built

- Authentication with role-based sidebar (three menus: leadership / team_lead / agent)
- Dashboard (leadership)
- Employee management page with Title + Reports To fields on the Add form
- Break-aware timeclock (60min unpaid lunch, 2x 15min paid breaks)
- Auto clock-out at scheduled shift end via pg_cron
- Employee Home page (what agents land on — stat cards, weekly hours chart, Today panel)
- Time Off requests
- Payroll history + invoicing
- Shift Settings admin UI (leadership + team_leads); per-campaign, confirmation prompt on time edits, audit log trigger logging every change
- Minutes Late This Week tracking; clock turns red past grace period
- Modern Trustee design (navy + orange #FFA700, Manrope font)

## What's left

**Next up (in priority order):**

1. **EOD form builder** — admin-only page where D + Paty define the questions each campaign answers at end of day (number / text / dropdown field types). Unblocks gating clock-out on EOD completion.
2. **Gate clock-out on EOD completed** — once #1 ships, agents must submit EOD before clocking out.
3. **Audit log viewer UI** — small page showing recent shift changes (trigger is already logging to `shift_settings_audit`). ~30min of work.
4. **Late notification digest** — batch email to team leads every 15 min listing agents past grace. Needs Resend or similar email setup.
5. **Team Coverage report** — summary of who's working which campaign per day.
6. **Modern Trustee polish** — Dashboard final pass, Auth editorial card, final QA (Tasks 9/10/11 from Modern Trustee design plan).

## Key files to know

- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` — title + permission booleans (`isLeadership`, `isTeamLead`, `isAgent`, strict matches like `isOwner`)
- `src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` — three menus per title tier
- `src/pages/EmployeeHome.tsx` — what agents see on login
- `src/pages/Timeclock.tsx` — break-aware clock-in/out, red clock past grace
- `src/pages/ShiftSettings.tsx` — per-campaign shift hours; team_lead scoped to own campaign
- `src/pages/Empleados.tsx` — employee list + Add form (with Title + Reports To)
- `src/App.tsx` — routing + `RoleHome` wrapper
- `supabase/migrations/20260413140000_titles_and_reports_to.sql` — reference for the title model

## Development commands

```
npm run dev          # start dev server
npm run build        # production build
npm run lint         # eslint
npm run test         # vitest once
npm run test:watch   # vitest watch mode
npx tsc --noEmit     # type-check without emitting
```

## Known gotchas

- Supabase MCP may point at the wrong project (the-living-word rather than JOI). Prefer writing SQL migration files for the user to run manually until this is fixed.
- `.git/index.lock` can get stuck if a terminal is closed mid-commit. Fix: `rm -f .git/index.lock`.
- The `employees` table has `client_id`, not `campaign_id`. Clients are campaigns in this app.
- shadcn Table uses `<TableHeader>` as the `<thead>` wrapper and `<TableHead>` as the `<th>` cell. Easy to swap by accident.
- `user_profiles.role` is auto-synced from `employees.title` by a trigger (`trg_sync_user_profile_role`). Don't write to `role` directly — update `title` and let the trigger handle it.
